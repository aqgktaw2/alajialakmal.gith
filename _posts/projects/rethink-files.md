### [Rethink Files](https://beta.rethinksoftware.com/ "Rethink Files")

Rethink Files is a file browser app that helps organize, search, and share files across any cloud.

During my current role as a Software Engineer at Rethink Labs, Inc., I am tasked with improving the frontend UI of the Next.js app, focusing on mobile responsiveness, accessibility, and design consistency. Some of my frontend work solves the major pain point of users not being able to use the app's full potential on their mobile devices. 

At the same time, I am also working on new API integrations with cloud storage providers/cloud apps such as ownCloud, Droplr, Basecamp, and Slack.
