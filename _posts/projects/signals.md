### [Signals Analytics](https://www.signals-analytics.com/)

Signals Analytics is a tech company that offers a next-generation advanced analytics platform that is used by many of the world’s leading consumer brands for optimizing their product portfolios. During my role as a Web Developer at Beacon Digital, I was tasked with building out Signals Analytics' website. With my HTML, CSS, Sass, and JavaScript skills, and the help of the module-based template system of HubSpot CMS, the team and I were able to deliver a performant, responsive, and easy-to-manage website solution completed with a blog system of multiple post types.
