### [Growers](https://growers.ag/ "Growers")

Growers is a tech company that helps build stronger relationships between ag retailers and their farmers by enabling farmers to be more informed about products and services than ever before. During my role as a Web Developer at Beacon Digital, I was tasked with building out the Growers' new website theme with the Gutenberg blocks system from WordPress. With the power of React, I developed over 30 custom Gutenberg blocks, ranging from the most common patterns such as "2 Column Richtext Block", to some more advanced dynamic blocks such as a filterable and sortable "Recent Events Block". This brand new component-based approach of theme development not only makes the code more manageable but also enables non-technical website maintainers to make regular updates with an intuitive visual interface that is almost a 1:1 preview of the production website. To top it off, the team and I added a "new-room" blog With my HTML, CSS, Sass, and JavaScript skills, and the help of the module-based template system of HubSpot CMS, the team and I were able to deliver a performant, responsive, and easy-to-manage website solution completed with a blog system of multiple post types.
